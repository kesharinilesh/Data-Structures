        "### Arrays vs. Linked Lists\n",
        "- Arrays are contiguous blocks of memory that store elements of the same data type, while linked lists are a collection of nodes that store elements and pointers to the next node.\n",
        "- Arrays are preferred for random access and fixed-size data, while linked lists are suitable for dynamic data and frequent insertions or deletions.\n",
        "- Arrays are more efficient for searching and sorting operations due to their random access capability, while linked lists require linear traversal for such operations.\n",
        "- Arrays have better memory locality and cache performance, while linked lists require extra memory for storing pointers and have poorer cache performance.\n",
        "- Insertion and deletion operations on arrays require shifting of elements, while linked lists only require updating pointers.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Linked Lists vs. Stacks\n",
        "- Both linked lists and stacks are linear data structures that store elements and support insertion and deletion operations.\n",
        "- Stacks are a special kind of linked list where insertions and deletions are allowed only at the top, while linked lists allow insertions and deletions at any position.\n",
        "- Stacks are useful for applications where the last item added needs to be the first item removed (LIFO), such as expression evaluation and function call management.\n",
        "- Push operation adds an element to the top of the stack, while pop operation removes and returns the element at the top of the stack.\n",
        "- A stack can be implemented using a linked list by making the head of the list represent the top of the stack.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Linked Lists vs. Queues\n",
        "- Both linked lists and queues are linear data structures that store elements and support insertion and deletion operations.\n",
        "- Queues are a special kind of linked list where insertions are allowed at the back and deletions are allowed from the front, while linked lists allow insertions and deletions at any position.\n",
        "- Queues are useful for applications where the first item added needs to be the first item removed (FIFO), such as job scheduling and network packet routing.\n",
        "- Enqueue operation adds an element to the back of the queue, while dequeue operation removes and returns the element at the front of the queue.\n",
        "- A queue can be implemented using a linked list by maintaining two pointers, one for the front and one for the back of the queue."
